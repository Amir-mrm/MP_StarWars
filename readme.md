Hello my dear friends.
This is double Pouya's mini project ;)

This game is made by: <br>
**Pouya (Omidi && Tavakoli)** 

The game is simple: you have a spaceship and there are enemies all around you.
Your goal is to beat all the enemies and win the game.
Try not to hit the enemies or you will lose one heart.
You only have three lives, so be careful!

## How to play the game
Start by deciding whether you want to move or you want to attack.
After choosing what you want to do,
you then move with WASD keys and attack to the left and right with L and R keys.
## game environment
the game looks like this <br>
